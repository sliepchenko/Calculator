# ðŸ¥· **Calculator**

#### This project is an example, how we can implement popular design patterns in our JS. I have tried to show the best practices,  as good as I can. The main reason why I developed this project - it's to help my newbie buddies with understanding this theme. If you have any questions, advice or remark, feel free to mail me.
